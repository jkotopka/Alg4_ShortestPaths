# Alg4_ShortestPaths

----
Taking a look at the shortest paths algorithms in chapter 4.4 of [Algoithms 4th ed.](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

This repo will use some of the data types employed in the [Alg4_MST](https://github.com/jkotopka/Alg4_MST) repo, as well as new data types to represent weighted directed edges and a weighted digraph.
